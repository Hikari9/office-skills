/**
 * Stop hook. Closes the Herdr panes of delegated agents that have finished.
 *
 * Why a hook and not a rule: `office-core/skills/herdr/SKILL.md` has said for
 * several core releases that a dispatch is finished when its pane is gone, and
 * panes still accumulated one dead agent per dispatch, because closing depended
 * on the planner choosing to notice. This closes them mechanically, from the
 * ledger the spawn recipe writes.
 *
 * Stop, not PostToolUse: a delegated agent has just reported when the turn ends,
 * which is exactly the moment its pane became closable. PostToolUse would run
 * this on every tool call for no additional closures.
 *
 * It closes ONLY panes recorded in the ledger. `herdr pane list` also shows the
 * user's own panes and other sessions' panes, so the listing is never the input.
 *
 * Closable, with no role exceptions: `done` or gone (herdr answers
 * `agent_not_found`). An idle agent may have dropped its prompt, so it stays
 * open until completion is confirmed. A closed pane is not lost work — the
 * ledger records each agent's session id, so a session is restored by id in a
 * fresh pane. Continuity lives in the id and the agent's written report, never
 * in a pane left open after confirmed completion.
 *
 * Never closable: an agent that is `working`, `blocked`, or `unknown`; a pane
 * whose agent has since moved to a different pane than the ledger recorded; and
 * anything not in the ledger.
 *
 * Opt-in, never installed silently: `eval/hooks/install.mjs --with-pane-hygiene`
 * in this repository, or the settings.json entry documented in
 * `office-core/skills/herdr/SKILL.md` for a standalone plugin install. The
 * runtime guard below is kept regardless — Herdr being present at install time
 * does not mean it is present at run time.
 *
 * Contract, same as the eval hooks: never blocks, exits 0 on any internal error,
 * and prints nothing when it closed nothing. A hygiene hook that can fail a turn
 * is worse than a dead pane.
