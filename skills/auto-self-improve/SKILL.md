description: Internal Auto Office v3 self-improvement primitive. Use only to create isolated learned-pattern or catalog/policy proposal work from historical evidence after deterministic sanitization, replay/evals where required, privacy lint, deterministic proposal identity, independent review, and lineage metadata. Never activate unmerged policy into the current run or merge its own proposal to main.

# Auto Self Improve

Work in a separate worktree/branch from the family whose policy is pinned.

For learned patterns: private rows → deterministic sanitizer → minimal redacted evidence capsule → pattern compiler → deterministic privacy lint → public pattern with opaque evidence hash. Learned patterns may not directly change capability floors, reward definitions, hard exclusions, destructive permissions, maturity policy, or security boundaries.

For catalog/policy proposals: include replay where required, eval results, diff explanation, policy hash change, and independent review.

Use deterministic identity hashes before append/retry. Fetch/reconcile latest proposal branch, skip existing identity, apply if absent, commit/push, and retry a non-fast-forward once from fresh state. Never duplicate content because of races.

A merged PR is terminal; create a successor PR with lineage. Activation occurs only after maintainer merge to main plus the next clean runtime load.
