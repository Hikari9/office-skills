# Auto Review

Use a fresh/different reviewer session from the producer whenever the harness permits it. Never self-approve.

Focus prompts on concrete bypass paths, blast radius, protected paths, wrong-but-passing implementations, state/version mismatch, authority violations, and missing acceptance evidence rather than generic “review correctness.”

Findings use exactly: `accepted-material`, `accepted-minor`, `rejected-on-evidence`, `pending`. Full gate credit belongs only to accepted-material findings.

Resume the same reviewer session across rounds when possible so it retains prior uncertainty/findings, but never resume into a producer identity.

A defect exit earns gate-like credit only when it names a contradicted assumption and proves the current artifact was tested enough to expose it.
