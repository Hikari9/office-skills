name: auto-review
description: Internal Auto Office v3 independent review spoke. Use for plan review, code review, accepted-material/minor/rejected/pending finding disposition, pointed blast-radius and bypass analysis, repeated review rounds, or validating PLAN DEFECT and BRIEF DEFECT exits. Never reuse the producer session as its own independent reviewer.

# Auto Review

Use a fresh/different reviewer session from the producer whenever the harness permits it. Never self-approve. When `HERDR_ENV=1` and `herdr` is reachable, that fresh session is a Herdr pane, not an in-process subagent tool (see the top-level `SKILL.md`'s Dispatch and mutation section) — check this before dispatching, not after defaulting to whatever tool is already loaded.

Before invoking a plan reviewer or code reviewer, publish the router's `selection_disclosure` to the user and preserve it in the dispatch record/readback. It must name the exact invocation model identifier when available, canonical model ID, effort, harness/version, and the evidence-backed reason this reviewer route won.

Focus prompts on concrete bypass paths, blast radius, protected paths, wrong-but-passing implementations, state/version mismatch, authority violations, and missing acceptance evidence rather than generic “review correctness.”

Findings use exactly: `accepted-material`, `accepted-minor`, `rejected-on-evidence`, `pending`. Full gate credit belongs only to accepted-material findings.

Resume the same reviewer session across rounds when possible so it retains prior uncertainty/findings, but never resume into a producer identity.

A defect exit earns gate-like credit only when it names a contradicted assumption and proves the current artifact was tested enough to expose it.

## A review describes one tree state

A review is a statement about a specific tree state. If the producer is still editing that tree, the reviewer's findings, line numbers, and contamination check all describe something that no longer exists, and afterward nobody can tell which findings survived. Observed pattern: producer and reviewer sharing a working tree at the same time, or a repair round dispatched mid-review, both erode this without either side noticing until the findings stop lining up with the code. Giving a concurrent repair its own worktree, or waiting for the in-flight review to land, avoids the ambiguity; combining several partial repair rounds into one tends to cost less than paying for a full re-review per round.

Scope the contamination check to what changed between the review's start and end snapshot that falls outside the declared review scope — not to file authorship. A reviewer who never writes producer files will otherwise flag nearly every review as contaminated; the signal that actually matters is unscoped drift during the review window, regardless of who wrote it.

## Review round caps

`full`: 5 rounds. `express`: 2 rounds. A second CHANGES REQUIRED on the same task forces an orchestrator disposition, not an automatic re-plan. PLAN DEFECT and BRIEF DEFECT exit without consuming a round.
