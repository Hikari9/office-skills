description: Internal Auto Office v3 loop-driver spoke. Use after plan approval to dispatch waves without blocking, integrate dispatch branches through a validated merge, adjudicate contract disagreements, and hold the autonomy ceiling — proceeding end to end while never merging to main without an explicit user statement.

# Auto Loop

Dispatch every task in the current wave before waiting on any of them. One worktree per
dispatch, created off the run's pinned base SHA; workers never share a tree and never run git —
the orchestrator commits and merges. Two tasks in one wave never touch the same write scope; a
wave is only real if it can be drawn as disjoint.

Poll, never block. While a dispatch runs, the orchestrator may only touch write scopes no live
dispatch holds: planning later waves, reviewing returned output, preparing briefs, reading state.
A single blocking wait on one worker is a defect the moment another worker has already returned.
A wave ends when every dispatch in it has returned or been declared dead by two independent
liveness signals — one signal alone is not a death.

At integration: commit each worker's tree on its own dispatch branch, authored by the
orchestrator; merge dispatch branches into the run's integration branch in wave order; resolve
conflicts at the orchestrator, never by re-dispatching a worker into a tree it does not own; then
run the plan's validation commands on the merged result. A green worker tree is not evidence
about the merge — the first moment N parallel trees have ever existed together is after it.

When a test written against the pinned contract disagrees with an implementation, name which one
is wrong and why: repo convention outranks an ambiguous contract clause, and a contract clause
outranks an implementation's convenience. This is an adjudication, not a re-plan.

Round caps for review live in `auto-review`; do not restate them here.

After approval the run proceeds end to end with no further go-aheads. It bootstraps a plan-only
commit, named branch, and draft PR before the first task; commits each wave as it goes green;
runs verification and review rounds; removes the plan file and marks the PR ready for review at
closeout; and may merge dispatch branches into its own working branch. It never merges to `main`
unless the user stated so explicitly, in the approval or in the conversation — absent that
sentence, the run stops at a ready PR.

It stops for exactly two things: an external send, and a user-owned decision the plan did not
anticipate. Everything the plan named — production applies included — it executes without asking
again.
