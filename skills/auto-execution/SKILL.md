description: Internal Auto Office v3 execution spoke. Use after an accepted plan to validate execution packets, acquire mutable role/write-scope ownership, dispatch executors or workers through the selected harness adapter, enforce protected paths and blast-radius limits, handle takeover/version checks, self-review mutations, and return durable evidence without widening scope.

# Auto Execution

Before dispatch, validate both the run envelope and execution packet. Reject missing/contradictory mandatory fields. Require the router's `selection_disclosure`, publish it to the user before launching the executor/worker, and preserve it in the dispatch record and readback.

A packet must include base SHA, task scope, observable outcome, blast radius, allowed mutations, protected paths, validation commands, known-bad behavior to exclude, self-review, and rollback/restore notes.

Refuse to dispatch any executor or worker unless the run's `state.json` has `phase == "approved"`; a `phase` of `intake`, `planned`, or anything else is a hard stop, not a retry. A producer running `approve-plan` on its own behalf, without the user's verbatim words in `--quote`, is a protocol violation — the quote is what makes the approval attributable to the user rather than the agent. The recorded `approval` block is what a future PreToolUse hook will read to gate dispatch, so treat it as authoritative and never fabricate or backfill it.

Acquire the role lease/write scope. Never allow two independent mutable holders for the same scope. Treat takeover as a holder change requiring stale-state reconciliation.

Use the selected harness primitive; do not let a primitive redefine lifecycle authority. The producer self-reviews and self-verifies, but self-review is never independent approval.

Check `HERDR_ENV`/`herdr` reachability before choosing how to launch that primitive (see the top-level `SKILL.md`'s Dispatch and mutation section) — do not default to an in-process subagent tool just because it is already loaded and works.

If evidence contradicts the plan/brief assumption and continuing would violate outcome/safety, raise a supported `PLAN DEFECT` or `BRIEF DEFECT` instead of improvising a requirement change.
