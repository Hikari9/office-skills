description: Internal Auto Office v3 execution spoke. Use after an accepted plan to validate execution packets, acquire mutable role/write-scope ownership, dispatch executors or workers through the selected harness adapter, enforce protected paths and blast-radius limits, handle takeover/version checks, self-review mutations, and return durable evidence without widening scope.

# Auto Execution

Before dispatch, validate both the run envelope and execution packet. Reject missing/contradictory mandatory fields. Require the router's `selection_disclosure`, publish it to the user before launching the executor/worker, and preserve it in the dispatch record and readback.

A packet must include base SHA, task scope, observable outcome, blast radius, allowed mutations, protected paths, validation commands, known-bad behavior to exclude, self-review, and rollback/restore notes.

Enter dispatch from `state.json.phase == "approved"`; `intake`, `planned`, or anything else is a hard stop, not a retry. `--quote` is an audit record of what was approved, not a credential; the orchestrator may approve on the user's behalf toward subagents, so a quote it wrote is legitimate. A producer approving its own work is not. Never fabricate or backfill the `approval` block — its value is the record, and a record of something that did not happen is worth less than none.

The dispatch record carries the **observed** route identity, not the intended one. Every harness here can accept a launch and then run a different effort than the one routed — codex inherits `model_reasoning_effort` from its config, Claude inherits `modelSettings.<model>.effortLevel` from `~/.claude/settings.json`, agy hard-fails `--effort` on non-Gemini slugs — and none of them error on the downgrade, so a `selection_disclosure` echoed from the route result is intent with no evidence behind it. After the delegate's first turn, read the identity back off the harness (each `*-cli` primitive names its own readback), record the observed value beside the routed one, and relaunch on a mismatch while the dispatch is still cheap to discard. A hand-composed launch is the usual cause: `office_spawn.sh` builds argv from the adapter's `invocation.argv` and cannot silently drop a flag, while a retyped wrapper — a herdr `agent start ... -- <args>`, an inline command — carries only what was retyped.

Acquire the role lease/write scope: one mutable holder per scope. Treat takeover as a holder change requiring stale-state reconciliation.

Use the selected harness primitive; a primitive never redefines lifecycle authority. The producer self-reviews and self-verifies, but that is a pass, never an approval (lifecycle spec §8) — independent approval remains held by an agent that did not produce the work.

If evidence contradicts the plan/brief assumption and continuing would violate outcome/safety, raise a supported `PLAN DEFECT` or `BRIEF DEFECT` instead of improvising a requirement change.
