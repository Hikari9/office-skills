description: Directly invocable Auto Office v3 Agy CLI mechanics primitive. Use when a selected/explicit Agy harness dispatch needs exact launch flag ordering, dynamic model discovery, model-dependent effort handling, workspace pinning, timeout/quota-stall diagnosis, prompt transport, recovery, or Agy-specific failure attribution. Do not treat this primitive as a separate lifecycle office or proof of adapter promotion.

# Agy CLI primitive

Load `../../adapters/seed/agy.yaml` plus current local override. The shipped seed is `valid-unverified`.

```bash
agy --dangerously-skip-permissions --print-timeout 45m \
  --model "<exact display name>" --add-dir "<abs worktree path>" \
  --prompt="$(cat <brief>)"
```

- `--print-timeout 45m` — defaults to 5m; always raise it or the run dies mid-task.
- `--model` — resolve from local `agy models` at dispatch; agy publishes no `latest` alias, so a hardcoded slug is pinned to the day it was written. **Pass the display name from the second column, not the slug from the first.** Verified 2026-09-12 on agy 1.2.2: `--model claude-sonnet-4-6` (the slug) is accepted without error and silently falls back to the account default (observed: Gemini 3.7 Flash Low); `--model "Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Thinking)"` selects correctly. There is no unknown-model error, so the only way to catch this is to read the startup banner's model line before prompting — treat a banner mismatch as adapter invocation failure and restart rather than prompting the wrong route.
- **Prefer `--prompt=<value>` (the `=` form) over `--print <value>`.** `--print` must be the last flag immediately before the prompt or the prompt is silently swallowed and you get a greeting/banner back with exit 0 — that is invocation failure, not a routing signal; nothing was done. The `=` form binds the value to the flag and makes ordering irrelevant.
- **Stdin piping does not work.** The prompt must be bound to `--print`/`--prompt=`, never piped.
- `--add-dir` does not reliably select the workspace by itself — pin the absolute workspace root (and forbid the scratch dir) in the prompt text itself.
- `--effort low|medium|high` is **Gemini-only**. Passing it with a Claude or gpt-oss slug hard-fails the launch (`--effort is not supported for model "<slug>"`). Probe the model's effort support before assuming a house effort tier applies; if the slug doesn't support it, say so rather than substituting a tier.

## Quota and recovery

A stall after a few narration lines with nothing in `git status`/`git log` is quota, not slowness — confirm before believing an external cause.

- Clarifying-question stall or focused correction: `agy --continue` or `--conversation <id>`, same flag-ordering rules apply.
- Greeting/swallowed prompt: fix the flag form (prefer `--prompt=`) and relaunch; nothing was done.
- Quota stall: relaunch fresh or fall back to another brand for the remainder.
- **Feedback-survey stall:** agy interrupts a turn with an interactive survey ("How's the CLI experience so far? [1] Good [2] Fine [3] Bad [0] Skip"). Observed 2026-09-12 on 1.2.2: it appears mid-turn, the agent stops having written nothing, and the harness reports `done` rather than `blocked`, so a status poll reads as success. Dismiss with `send-keys 0`, then re-prompt explicitly ("nothing was written, resume from where you left off") — the model does not resume on its own. Confirm progress against the worktree with `git status --porcelain`, never against the reported status.

Launch as a background task with no pipes on stdout (never `tail`/`head` — both buffer until exit and defeat live tailing); read only the tail of the output file after completion. Never edit the tree it is writing to while it runs.

Diagnose a greeting/swallowed prompt or a banner model mismatch as adapter invocation failure, an `--effort` hard-fail as adapter/invocation, and narration-with-no-work under exhausted allowance as quota/account when evidence confirms it.
